      <p>Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there and I'll tell you all about how I became a prince in a town called Bel Air</p>

      <p>In West Philadelphia, born and raised. On the playground where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool and all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school.</p>
    
      <p>When a couple of guys, they were up to no good! Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. She said, "You're movin' with your Auntie and Uncle in Bel Air!"</p>
