      <p>I am 28 years old, and have lived in Richmond all my life. I have vast experience in child care and development programs, not just as a counselor, but as a manager and operations director as well throughout the past 8 years.</p>

      <p>I also had the pleasure of being a soccer coach for my former high school. At the end of my 4-year tenure, I had helped take a program that finished with 1 win in 2013 to 10 wins, including 3 playoff wins, in 2015.</p>

      <p>I believe that these two jobs have given me an incredible amount of experience, stories, and life lessons that will stick with me forever</p>

      <p>In my free time, you can find me watching soccer or football, playing with my niece, or hanging out with my dog, Chelsea.</p>
